## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — first public release (in preparation)

Everything below shipped during the pre-release arc (internal revisions
r1–r86). Highlights, newest first:

### Web playback & captions
- Instant streaming playback for web sources: loopback proxy → ffmpeg
  fragmented-MP4 remux → MSE (the only WKWebView path with sound), with
  seek-anywhere, scrub-freeze, frame-accurate WebCodecs scrub preview, and an
  automatic download-to-cache fallback.
- Single-clock A/V/caption sync: the streamed muxed `<video>` is the one clock
  for audio, picture, and captions, so the transcript highlight and on-video
  captions stay locked to what you hear by construction.
- "Fix timing" — one click re-times loose YouTube auto-captions from the same
  cached audio with your active engine (Whisper or Parakeet).
- ffprobe sidecar bundled so HLS/DASH downloads remux correctly.
- J-K-L variable-speed shuttle, type-a-timecode HUD, aspect controls,
  fullscreen, frame stepping, in/out marks with full-clip default.

### Transcription & speakers
- Two transcription engines: local Whisper (whisper.cpp) with model manager, or
  NVIDIA Parakeet TDT v3 (on-device Core ML, word-level timing) — exactly one
  active engine at a time, picked in Settings. Or one-click source-caption
  download (speaker voice tags preserved, best-track ranking).
- On-device diarization: SpeakerKit primary, FluidAudio fallback; speaker
  editor with rename, drag-to-merge, per-turn overrides, color-coded roster.
- Transcript workspace: search (text + speaker modes), karaoke highlight,
  click-to-seek, pop-out window, history, TXT/MD/SRT/PDF export, on-video
  caption overlay with broadcast-style line breaking.

### Export
- Lossless cuts or re-encodes, MP3 audio export, export queue, snapshots at
  source resolution, transcript-driven burned captions.

### Shortcuts & settings
- AI Summary: chat with / summarize a transcript via a local llama.cpp model
  (speaker-aware, markdown, clickable timecodes, PDF/text export).
- Fully editable keyboard shortcuts — rebind any transport/marking/app action
  in Settings → Commands; the ⌘K palette reflects live bindings.
- Settings backup: export / import all preferences + shortcuts to a JSON file,
  plus reset-to-defaults. Collapsible chevron sections across every tab.
- Caption controls: legible system-font dropdown (default Verdana), numeric px
  size, background opacity, text colour; speaker label above, left-aligned.

### Security & hardening
- Per-session capability token on the loopback media proxy (SSRF/local-snoop
  protection), upstream scheme validation, `-ss` input clamping.
- Two adversarial review waves (92 findings adjudicated): packaged-app
  sidecar path fix, pop-out panel permissions, UTF-8 panics, cancel-path and
  JobRegistry gaps, stale-file scans, entity decoding, ~50 more.
- All sidecars are self-contained static builds enforced by `otool -L`
  guard rails; binaries assembled locally via `npm run setup` (not in git).

### Infrastructure
- CI: tsc, vitest, cargo check/test/clippy (zero-warning policy), swift build.
- Generated TS bindings from Rust structs (ts-rs); typed `AppError` surface;
  build-ID handshake against stale binaries.
